        <title>Metacognitive learning under adaptive help-seeking interventions</title>
        <description>&lt;p.small&gt;Cognitive tutoring agents can be extended with a help-seeking tutor module that tries to identify hint abuse and hint avoidance and provide corrective feedback. Here we extended previous work done by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center LearnLab in order to determine whether users interacting with this type of agent demonstrated improved metacognitive skills over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p.small&gt;Metacognitive skill here is measured by the appropriateness of their resource and hint use conditional on their estimated knowledge of the mathematical concept being tested. In order to design the most effective interventions capable of delivering personalized adaptive instruction to students, we need to understand whether these metacognitive abilities are dissociable from the cognitive skills targeted by the tutoring system, and whether they are amenable to intervention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p.small&gt;We were particularly interested in whether these metacognitive learning curves revealed improvement in metacognitive skillfulness in a domain-general or context-specific manner. We found context-specific improvement in metacognitive resourcefulness and self-knowlege that showed limited to non-existent generalization to new problem domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Collaborative problem solving and assessment</title>
        <description>&lt;p.small&gt;This is an ongoing project in collaboration with researchers at NYU Steinhardt&#39;s Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology and the Computational Psychometrics Research Center of the Educational Testing Service. Our research addresses two fundamental questions in the nascent field of computer-supported collaborative learning and assessment:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p.small&gt;First, can we determine the properties of assessment items that foster productive collaborations in an online/face-to-face partnered assessment setting?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p.small&gt;Second, how can we use these assessment items to separately estimate an individual’s mathematical problem-solving ability from tasks completed in isolation as compared to the individual’s ability estimated from performance on tasks which encourage or require collaboration? We focus here not on the assessment of their collaborative teamwork skills per se, but on measuring their cognitive ability within this collaborative and dynamic context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p.small&gt;In this project we are adapting established high school and college-level mathematics assessment items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress in order to elicit more collaborative and interdependent problem solving. These adapted items are used in implementing individual and collaborative assessment frameworks within OpenEdX courseware. We are working to develop a taxonomy of item characteristics associated with increased interdependence in domains with well-defined problems and solution paths, as is typical of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p.small&gt;Code for this project is primarily written in a combination of Python, XML, and Javascript. Materials are not yet publicly available, but for further information and background on the project, please see the links provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
