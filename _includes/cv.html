                   <p.small>Substantively, my primary research interests lie in developing a framework for the assessment of collaborative problem-solving within educational technology platforms, understanding the relationship between metacognitive and cognitive factors in modeling learning growth curves, and applying causal inference methods to evaluation of policy interventions in education and racial justice issues.</p.small>
