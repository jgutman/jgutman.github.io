                    <p>I'm currently a graduate student at the <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu">NYU Center for Data Science</a>, where I work as a teaching assistant, researcher, and statistical consultant, completing my M.S. in Data Science in 2016. My background is in cognitive science, educational measurement, and quantitative psychology, with a strongly computational and Bayesian bent. I earned my B.S. in Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences from the <a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a>.</p>

                    <p>Substantively, my primary research interests lie in developing a framework for the assessment of collaborative problem-solving within educational technology platforms, understanding the relationship between metacognitive and cognitive factors in learning growth curve rates, and causal inference for policy interventions in education and racial justice issues.</p>
