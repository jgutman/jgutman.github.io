                    <p.small>I'm currently a graduate student at the <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu">NYU Center for Data Science</a>, where I work as a teaching assistant, graduate researcher, and statistical consultant, and expect to complete my M.S. in Data Science in 2016. </p>

                      <p.small>My background is in educational measurement, cognitive science, and machine learning, with a strongly computational and Bayesian orientation. I earned my B.S. in Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences from the <a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a> in 2012.</p>

                    <p.small>Substantively, my primary research interests lie at the intersection of educational technology, measurement, and computer supported collaborative learning. Currently I'm interested in <p.small><b><i>1)</i></b> developing a framework for the assessment of collaborative problem-solving within educational technology platforms,</p> <p.small><b><i>2)</i></b> understanding the relationship between metacognitive and cognitive factors in modeling learning growth curves,</p> <p.small>and <b><i>3)</i></b> applying causal inference methods to evaluation of policy interventions in education and racial justice issues.</p>
