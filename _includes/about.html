                    <p.small>I'm currently a graduate student at the <a.active href="http://cds.nyu.edu">NYU Center for Data Science</a.active>, where I work as a teaching assistant, researcher, and statistical consultant, completing my M.S. in Data Science in 2016. </p.small>

                      <p.small>My background is in educational measurement, cognitive science, and machine learning, with a strongly computational and Bayesian bent. I earned my B.S. in Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences from the <a.active href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a.active> in 2012.</p.small>

                    <p.small>Substantively, my primary research interests lie in developing a framework for the assessment of collaborative problem-solving within educational technology platforms, understanding the relationship between metacognitive and cognitive factors in learning growth curve rates, and causal inference for policy interventions in education and racial justice issues.</p.small>
