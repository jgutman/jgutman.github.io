                    <p.small>I'm currently a graduate student at the <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu" target="_new tab">NYU Center for Data Science</a>, where I work as a teaching assistant, graduate researcher, and statistical consultant. I have completed my coursework and will graduate with my M.S. in Data Science in December 2016. </p>

                      <p.small>My background is in educational measurement, cognitive science, and machine learning, with a strongly computational and Bayesian orientation. I earned my B.S. in <a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu" target="_newtab">Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester</a> in 2012, where I concentrated in psycholinguistics and language development.</p>

                      <p.small>I transition pretty fluidly between Python, R, and SQL, and typically use all three in tandem for most projects, as the task requires.</p>

                    <p.small>Substantively, my primary research interests lie at the intersection of educational technology, measurement, and computer supported collaborative learning. Currently I'm interested in: </p> <p.small><b><i>1)</i></b> developing a framework for the assessment of collaborative problem-solving within educational technology platforms,</p> <p.small><b><i>2)</i></b> understanding the relationship between metacognitive and cognitive factors in modeling learning growth curves, and </p> <p.small><b><i>3)</i></b> applying causal inference methods to policy evaluation in interventions addressing educational access, refugee services, and racial justice. </p>
