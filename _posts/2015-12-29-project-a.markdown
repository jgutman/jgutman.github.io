description: <p.small>My team worked with a large, K-12 educational services center in rural Ohio to develop an integrated early intervention system to identify and target students at risk of not graduating high school in time. Built a predictive model in Python and prototyped a user-friendly dashboard for educators to enable end-users to target and deliver the appropriate interventions to students 3-4 years earlier than previously possible. We developed interpretable risk factors for both the random forest and logistic regression models and provided the partners with visualizations of risk score trajectories and ranked predictions for all current students in grades 6-10. I collaborated with a team of statisticians, computer scientists, project managers, and educators to streamline code and develop a field-testable intervention using 15 years of longitudinal student data from the largest educational service region in Ohio.</p><p.small>We worked with Python and SQL to store dozens of tables on over 30 thousand pre-K through grade 12 students, and built an integrated and well-documented pipeline to extract, transform, and load the raw data, clean and standardize the messy student data, and automatically generate over a hundred grade-dependent features for all students in the specified cohorts, systematically imputing missing data where necessary. We developed a fully configurable predictive model that could be simply specified using a standardized template to allow for the parallelized and automated fitting of tens of thousands of tuned models at all grade levels of predictions. This customizable pipeline allowed our team to easily specify how many years of past data to train in, which features to include in the model, what family of classifiers to include, what outcome variable the model should predict, and how extensive the grid search options used in fitting the models should be.</p> <p.small>For a non-technical introduction to our project, read our <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2016/08/05/mvesc-finding-the-missing-students-who-dont-graduate-on-time/">blog post</a> or <a href="http://www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/story/news/local/2016/06/21/mvesc-part-summer-fellowship-program/86187600/">the local newspaper article</a> written about our team's early work.
