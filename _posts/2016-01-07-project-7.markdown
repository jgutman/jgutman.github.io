description: <p.small>My thesis explored how we can model the functional constraints and cognitive biases that successive cohorts of learners impose on their linguistic input in order to make the language system more functionally communicative (i.e. language needs to be expressive, compositional, parsimonious, and learnable). </p> <p.small>Using a Flash web applet shown to MTurk workers, learners engaged in an educational game to learn the vocabulary and grammar of an artificial language. Learners were tasked with producing utterances in the artificial language that would be subsequently provided to the following learning cohort as linguistic input. We looked at gradual changes in the morphosyntactic structure from the first to the last generation of each linguistic diffusion chain to determine if the cumulative changes imposed by learners demonstrated a tendency to reduce conditional entropy (i.e. unpredictable/context-independent variation), particularly in the word order and agent/theme case-marking system.</p> <p.small>The key research question here was&#58; do learners mutate their input in a manner that is consistent with a bias towards systematicity? Preliminary analyses suggested a bias towards reducing or eliminating unsystematic variation in linguistic structure not predictable from context. This experiment served as a proof-of-concept for the implementation of iterated artificial learning experiments in an online setting.</p> <p.small>Code for this project was primarily written in Python. Audacity sound editing software, Poser video rendering and animation, and Amazon's Mechanical Turk were used to support the content creation and task automation used in the experiments.</p>
