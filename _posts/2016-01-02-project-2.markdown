description: <p.small>Hospitals with high levels of hospital-acquired infections risk losing Medicare funds and experiencing high rates of preventable patient mortality. Using autoregressive tree models and logistic regression, we developed a system for early identification of hospitals exceeding a threshold rate of central-line associated adverse events conditional on hospital characteristics. We incorporated a cost-sensitive risk function to bias the model towards increased sensitivity in identifying hospitals likely to exceed a threshold rate of hospital-acquired infections, controlling for patient characteristics using propensity score matching at the patient level.</p> <p.small>To correct for prediction error arising from the rarity of the adverse events of interest relative to all opportunities for infection, we used a proxy target modeling approach. We developed a framework for evaluating the kinds of patient events that function as reliable target variables for predicting infection rates, and demonstrated the feasibility of proxy logistic regression in flagging at-risk hospitals prior to a spike in adverse patient events, in order to enable implementation and targeted enforcement of stricter infection prevention protocol and interventions.</p> <p.small>The analyses and models used in this project were all written in Python using the scikit-learn library for machine learning and statistical modeling, as well as matplotlib for plotting and data visualization. De-identified open data were obtained directly from the Medicare.gov website. </p>
