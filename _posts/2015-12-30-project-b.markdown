description: <p.small>Using Hadoop Streaming with MapReduce in Python, we analyzed over 93 million yellow cab, green cab, and Uber trips in NYC to build a spatiotemporal Poisson regression model of counts of taxi pickups, grouped by neighborhood, hour of day, and day of week. We applied anomaly detection methods to highlight neighborhoods that are unusually busy for the time of day and day of the week. All trips were geocoded using Rtree spatial indexing to place each taxi pickup into one of 52 NYC neighborhoods, and the MapReduce algorithm was to reduce the 93 million raw individual data points to 23,600 spatiotemporal buckets of counts.</p> <p.small>Using a cross-validated Lasso-penalized generalized linear model, the number of taxi pickups was modeled as a conditional Poisson distribution. Outputs included an interactive visualization heat map of the density of taxi pickups in the city grouped by hour and day of the week and visualizations of peak service hours by neighborhood and taxi type. Taxi data was joined with NYC neighborhood shapefiles and MTA subway station coordinates  to evaluate the statistical significance of average distance to the subway on the number of pickups in a neighborhood. This project involved an integrated pipeline of data transformation, analysis, and visualization in Python, SQL, Hadoop, and R. Using these methods, we identify several spatiotemporal cells where the confluence of day, time, neighborhood, distance to subway, and other factors reveals a surprising interaction--for example, that LaGuardia airport is unusually busy Mondays at 9am.Identifying these anomalies allows us to suggest "hot spots" and "dead zones" for every hour of the day-week cycle, and thus dispatch a larger number of taxis to wait nearby in these unusually busy neighborhoods.</p>
