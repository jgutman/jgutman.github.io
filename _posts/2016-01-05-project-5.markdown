description: <p.small>Using data from Project LISTEN, I built a model to predict the probability of a student reading a word successfully with no hesitation or disfluencies, given information about the student’s reading ability, prior reading experience, and the difficulty of the word attempted. In particular, I was interested in whether the specific type of help provided by the tutor during previous unsuccessful encounters with the word in question differentially affected the probability of success in the current encounter—are some kinds of hints more effective in certain contexts than others?</p> <p.small>The children have the ability to request help, and the Reading Tutor can also provide help automatically. Because the Reading Tutor randomly chooses from up to 13 available help types, it creates a kind of natural experiment&mdash;the best proxy we have to a true randomized controlled experiment.</p> <p.small>Using pooled, unpooled, and hierarchical logistic regressions and classification tree models, we predict the probability of successful reading trials given word- and child-specific effects. Multiple approaches to feature selection including AIC-based stepwise methods were used to develop a model that accurately predicts reading difficulty, with unpooled estimates for each specific help type and shrinkage-adjusted estimates towards the common mean across all available help types.</p> <p.small>Using these models, we can simulate an intervention where the type of help most likely to result in success for a particular child on a particular word is provided, instead of a randomly selected hint. I was able to demonstrate that while no overall differences in effectiveness between different kinds of hints were evident, some context-specific effects of type of help were non-zero, and selecting the optimal type of hint at each trial can potentially improve intervention effectiveness.</p><p.small>All models were developed in R, primarily using the <tt>glmnet</tt>, <tt>caret</tt>, and <tt>rpart</tt> packages for classification trees, generalized linear models, and stepwise algorithms. Data obtained from Project LISTEN researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
